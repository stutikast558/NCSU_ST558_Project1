# New York City Demographics
## Introduction
The **Iris flower data set** or **Fisher's Iris data set** is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_ as an example of [linear discriminant analysis]( http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis).

## Data

### XML source
```{r read0, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
require(XML)
require(methods)
# Parse the XML file and prepare a data frame from second node leaving the headers
result <- xmlParse("rows.xml")
raw_df <- xmlToDataFrame(node=getNodeSet(result,"//response/row/row"))
# Coverting full data frame of factors into numeric variables
raw_df2 <- mutate_if(raw_df, is.factor, ~ as.numeric(levels(.x))[.x])
# Changing the Jurisdiction variable into characher
raw_df2$jurisdiction_name <- as.character(raw_df2$jurisdiction_name)
#By end of this code chunk. we have completed the preparing the base data frame in raw_df2
```
### Demographic summary by the Zip code (Jurisdiction)

```{r read1, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# Addtional Categorical Variables being added based on percentahe demographic variables
# Setting the Predominanct demographic variable Main_Demo if any demograhic is > 50%, if none is >50% set to Mixed
demo_df <- mutate(raw_df2,
Main_Demograph = ifelse(percent_white_non_hispanic > 0.5, "White",
            ifelse(percent_black_non_hispanic > 0.5, "Black",
            ifelse(percent_asian_non_hispanic > 0.5, "Asian",
            ifelse(percent_pacific_islander   > 0.5, "Pacific Islander",
            ifelse(percent_hispanic_latino    > 0.5, "Hispanic",
            ifelse(percent_american_indian    > 0.5, "American Indian",
            ifelse(percent_ethnicity_unknown  > 0.5, "Unknown",
                                                     "Mixed" ))))))),
Citizenship   = ifelse(percent_us_citizen         > 0.5, "US Citizen",
            ifelse(percent_permanent_resident_alien > 0.5, "Permanent Resident",

Public_Assistance = ifelse(percent_receives_public_assistance > 0.33, "More than one thrid receive","No/Not much"))
# Set Categorical variables as factors
demo_df$Main_Demograph <- as.factor(demo_df$Main_Demograph)
demo_df$Citizenship <- as.factor(demo_df$Citizenship)
demo_df$Public_Assistance <- factor(demo_df$Public_Assistance)
#Order the factor variables
demo_df$Main_Demograph<- ordered(demo_df$Main_Demograph, levels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Pacific Islander","Hispanic","American Indian", "Unknown", "Mixed"))
demo_df$Citizenship <- ordered(demo_df$Citizenship, levels = c("US Citizen", "Permanent Resident", "Other Citizen", "Unknown", "Mixed"))
demo_df$Public_Assistance <- ordered(demo_df$Public_Assistance, levels = c("More than one thrid receive", "No/Not much"))
select (demo_df,jurisdiction_name, Main_Demograph, Citizenship, Public_Assistance) %>% DT::datatable(demo_df,rownames=FALSE)
```
## Numeric Summaries
Weâ€™ll consider three categorical variables from the data set: main demographic, their citizenship status , and whether or not they receive public assistance from the Government.

### Full table
This two way table shows the count of the Jurisdictions by their demographic and citizenship.  

```{r read2, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
library(tables)
table(demo_df$Main_Demograph,demo_df$Citizenship) %>% knitr::kable(caption="Demographic and Citizenship information")
```

### Tables by Govt. Public Assistance Indicator
Below are three way tables show the count of the Jurisdictions by their demographic with a breakup by whether they recive Goverment Public assistance.

```{r read3, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
tab <- table(demo_df$Main_Demograph,demo_df$Citizenship, demo_df$Public_Assistance)
```

```{r read4, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
tab[,,1] %>% knitr::kable(caption="Count of Jurisdictions that have more than one third population receive Government Public Assistance:")
```

```{r read5, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
tab[,,2] %>% knitr::kable(caption="Count of Jurisdictions that does not need much Government Public Assistance:")
```
## Visuals
### One Variable
Below two bar charts are one variable charts. The first bar chart below indicates the count of the jurisdictions by their predominant demographic (more than 50% population). The second bar chart shows the count of jurisdictionss by their Citizenship status.

```{r read6, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Main_Demograph))
a + geom_bar()+labs(x = "Pedominant Demograhic (More than 50% Population)") 
b <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Citizenship))
b + geom_bar()+labs(x = "Pedominant Citizenship (More than 50% Population)") 
c <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Public_Assistance))
c + geom_bar()+labs(x = "Govt Public Assistance") 
```

### Two Variables
Below three bar charts are two variable charts. The first bar chart indicates the count of the jurisdictions  by their demographic with each colored bar indicating the whether more than one of the demograpic receice Goverment public assistance or not. The second bar chart shows the the count of jurisdictions by their citizenship status  with each colored bar indicating whether more than one of the demograpic receice Goverment public assistance or not. The third bar chart shows the count of the jurisdictions by citizenship status with each colored bar indicating the predominant demographic.

```{r read7, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
d <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Main_Demograph))
d + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(Public_Assistance)), position = "dodge")+labs(x = "Prodominant Demographic",fill ="")
e <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Citizenship))
e + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(Public_Assistance)), position = "dodge")+labs(x = "Citizenship Status",fill ="")
e <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Citizenship))
e + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(Main_Demograph)), position = "dodge")+labs(x = "Citizenship Status",fill ="Main Demograhic")
```

### Three Variables
Below bar charts is a three variable chart that indicates count of jurisdictions by their main demographic with each colored bar indicating whether more than one of the demograpic receice Goverment public assistance or not. This chart is then grouped by the third variable, the Citizenship status.

```{r read8, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE,message=FALSE}
f <- ggplot(demo_df, aes(x=demo_df$Main_Demograph))
f + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(Public_Assistance)), position = "dodge")+labs(x = "Main Demographic",fill ="")+facet_wrap(demo_df$Citizenship)
```
